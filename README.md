Linker

====================Copyright (C) 2014 Daran Zhang. All rights reserved.================================

The linker takes individually compiled modules and creates a single executable by resolving external symbol references (e.g. variables and functions) and module relative addressing by assigning global addresses after placing the modulesâ€™ object code at global addresses.

HHOW TO COMPILE:

Simply compile this cpp file on linux using g++.

Command to compile 'linker.cc' is: 

g++ linker.cc -o linker

Then the compiler will make a executable file titled 'linker'.

HOW TO RUN:

After compiling, just use the command below to run the program:

./linker [input filename]

Then the program will start to run. The linker will start to work and the output will display on the screen.
